# 🚀 Keycloakify + Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI: Enhancing Keycloak Themes 🚀

Welcome to the Keycloakify + Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI repository! This project is a community-driven effort aimed at making Keycloak theming more accessible, modern, and easy to customize. By integrating Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI, I am upgrading the Keycloakify ecosystem, one page at a time, to meet the needs of modern front-end development.

This project is designed to be developer-friendly, making it easy to customize themes or individual components to suit your specific needs. With the help of Storybook, developers can modify components in isolation, streamlining the customization process.

I strongly believe in the Keycloak ecosystem and found Keycloakify to be an extremely stable and reliable tool for creating custom Keycloak themes. My goal is to further enhance Keycloakify for this specific front-end use case and to make it easier for others to build on top of my work.

```typescript
const buttonVariants = cva(
    "inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-full text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-all focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 hover:scale-105",
    {
        variants: {
            variant: {
                default:
                    "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/50 hover:dark:bg-primary/30 hover:dark:text-secondary-foreground ",
                destructive:
                    "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",
                outline:
                    "border border-input border-foreground bg-background text-foreground hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
                secondary: "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
                ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
                link: "text-primary bg-background underline-offset-4 hover:underline"
            },
            size: {
                default: "h-10 px-4 py-2",
                sm: "h-9 rounded-md px-3",
                lg: "h-11 rounded-md px-8",
                icon: "h-10 w-10"
            }
        },
        defaultVariants: {
            variant: "default",
            size: "default"
        }

## Install Maven:

You need Maven installed to build and test the Keycloak theme.

macOS:

brew install maven
```

Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install maven
```

Windows:

```bash
choco install openjdk && choco install maven
```

## Testing the Component with Docker

Run this command:

```bash
npx keycloakify start-keycloak
```

> ** Note: Keycloak version 26 is not supported yet. **

```bash
npx keycloakify start-keycloak --keycloak-version 25.0.2
```

## 📦 Building the Keycloak Theme

```bash
npm run build-keycloak-theme
```

Keycloakify generates .jar files for different Keycloak versions by default. You can customize this to suit your deployment needs. Learn more in the Keycloakify documentation.

## 🛠 Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI Integration

This project integrates Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components with Keycloakify, making it easier to create custom Keycloak themes. You can easily customize individual components or the entire theme by leveraging Storybook.

Isolated Component Customization with Storybook: Every component in this project is storybook-ready, allowing you to develop and customize components in isolation. This means you can focus on fine-tuning each UI element without worrying about the rest of the application. Storybook helps in visually testing and experimenting with different styles and themes.
With the integration of Tailwind CSS, you get access to utility-first CSS for rapid styling, while ShadCN UI components provide a robust design system for professional UIs.
